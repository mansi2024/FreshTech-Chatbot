# Chatbot-FreshTech- 

It's the mini Website made with the Intention to help Freshers at the beginning or in between development by answering queries via Chatbot,
which could be trained via Dialogflow-I have trained it a little, but the scope of training is really high.
The beautiful and interactive Website with Chatbot included in it, is named as FreshTech for helping freshers.

## Tech and Tool Used.
- Node
